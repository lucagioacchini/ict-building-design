# ICT in Building Design
This work is part of the project for the ICT in Building Design course at Politecnico di Torino.  
The main purpose of the work is to develop a simple office building in Moscow (RUS) in order to evaluate its energy efficiency. Furthermore the building energy classification is performed through the Energy Signature technique and finally a machine-learning based predictive control system for the internal temperature is attempted.<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^{i \pi} = -1">


<!-- ABSTRACT -->
## Abstract
In the 2020 European strategy, the European Union aims at achieving a 20\% share of renewable energies and the 20\% reduction of the overall energy consumption. With a share of 64.1\% in the residential sector, heating is one of the largest primary energy consumers. On average, non-residential buildings exceed residential ones by 40\% in terms of energy use per $$\SI{}{m^2}$$.  
In order to reduce the overall energy requirement, the optimum building retrofitting design in terms of thermal transmittance (or U-value, which is central in the energy transmission through the building envelope) is essential. Another point of high relevance in the context of renewable energy use is the prediction of energy demand, due to the need for decentralization of the electricity grid and the often time-bound availability of renewable energy sources. Through intelligent networking, load management and demand flexibilization, an efficient integration of renewable energies and a stable grid condition can be achieved in the context of the conversion from the traditional power grid into so-called smart grids.  
This paper therefore first deals with the optimization of the U-value, the Window to Wall Ratio and the thickness of the windows Argon filled area of an exemplary office building in Moscow and then with the prediction of its monthly energy consumption of the same building. Finally, the forecast of the next hour average internal temperature has been performed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to lay the foundation for an automated environmental control system.
