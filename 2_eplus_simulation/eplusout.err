   **   ~~~   ** ...if the two zones are expected to have significantly different temperatures, the proper "reverse" construction should be created.
   **   ~~~   ** ...this problem for this pair will not be reported again.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
